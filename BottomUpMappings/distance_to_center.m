%DISTANCE_TO_CENTER Bottom-up Mapping (n-Dimensional L2 Distance Test)
%   DISTANCE_TO_CENTER is a bottom-up mapping that returns the L2-distance of 
%   the given designs to a center defined as a parameter. When such measure is
%   given a (lower and) upper limit, the resulting regions of good designs is a
%   (hollow) sphere. Multiple centers can be defined, with the distance being
%   returned for each one.
%
%   PERFORMANCEMEASURE = DISTANCE_TO_CENTER(DESIGNSAMPLE) 
%   receives the spatial coordinates of the design points in DESIGNSAMPLE
%   and returns in PERFORMANCEMEASURE the L2 distance to the origin (0,0,...).
%
%   PERFORMANCEMEASURE = DISTANCE_TO_CENTER(DESIGNSAMPLE,SYSTEMPARAMETER) 
%   allows the specification of center(s) other than the origin in 
%   SYSTEMPARAMETER. Each center must be given as a new row in the array.
%
%   Input: 
%       - DESIGNSAMPLE : (nSample,d) double 
%           -- (i,j) : spatial coordinate j of each sample point i
%       - SYSTEMPARAMETER : (nCenter,d) double 
%           -- (i,j) : spatial coordinate j of reference center i
%
%   Output:
%       - PERFORMANCEMEASURE : (nSample,nCenter) double 
%           -- (i,j) : L2-norm distance of sample point i to reference center j
