%TWO_ELLIPSES_REQUIREMENT_SPACE Bottom-Up Mapping (Requirement Spaces Testing)
%   TWO_ELLIPSES_REQUIREMENT_SPACE is a bottom-up mapping characterized by two 
%   ellipsoids:
%       - Designs inside the first ellipse meet the requirements of the problem
%       - Designs inside the second ellipse are physically feasible
%   With this, one can test any methods they wish for requirement spaces.
%   Designs are inside each sphere if the returned measure has a value less than
%   or equal to 1.
%
%   The characteristics of the ellipses can be set using system parameters. 
%   However, they also have default values for quick analysis.
%   Unless specified, the first ellipsoid (performance) has the following 
%   characteristics:
%       - Center: [v1,v2] = [11,5]
%       - Principal Semiaxes: [a,b] = [7,2]
%       - Rotation Angle: theta = 1.8 rad
%   Unless specified, the second ellipsoid (physical feasibility) has the  
%   following characteristics:
%       - Center: [v1,v2] = [5,6]
%       - Principal Semiaxes: [a,b] = [7,2]
%       - Rotation Angle: theta = 0.2 rad
%
%   PERFORMANCEMEASURE = TWO_ELLIPSES_REQUIREMENT_SPACE(DESIGNSAMPLE) receives 
%   the spatial coordinates of each design sample in DESIGNSAMPLE and returns 
%   the ellipse-norm regarding the performance of each in PERFORMANCEMEASURE.
%
%   PERFORMANCEMEASURE = TWO_ELLIPSES_REQUIREMENT_SPACE(DESIGNSAMPLE,
%   SYSTEMPARAMETER) allows one to specify the characteristics of each ellipse.
%   The first row corresponds to the performance ellipse, and the second row 
%   to the physical feasibility ellipse.
%
%   [PERFORMANCEMEASURE,PHYSICALFEASIBILITYMEASURE] = 
%   TWO_ELLIPSES_REQUIREMENT_SPACE(...)  
%   also returns the ellipse-norm of each design regarding their physical 
%   feasibility in PHYSICALFEASIBILITYMEASURE;
%
%   Input: 
%       - DESIGNSAMPLE : (nSample,2) double
%           -- (1) : spatial coordinate 1
%           -- (2) : spatial coordinate 2
%       - SYSTEMPARAMETER [optional] : (2,5) double
%           -- (1,:) : performance measure parameters
%           -- (2,:) : physical feasibility parameters
%           -- (:,1) : ellipse center in 1st dimension (vx)
%           -- (:,2) : ellipse center in 2nd dimension (vy)
%           -- (:,3) : semi-major axis in 1st dimension (a)
%           -- (:,4) : semi-major axis in 2nd dimension (b)
%           -- [optional] (:,5) : rotation angle around center (theta)
%
%   Output:
%       - PERFORMANCEMEASURE : (nSample,1) double
%       - PHYSICALFEASIBILITYMEASURE : (nSample,1) double
