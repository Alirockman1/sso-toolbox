%FINITE_DIFFERENCES_DERIVATIVE Derivative approximation using finite differences
%   FINITE_DIFFERENCES_DERIVATIVE numerically calculates the derivative of  
%   arbitrary order of an input signal using a finite differences approximation. 
%   The derivative is done by finite differences centered on each considered 
%   point; for left and right extremes, where centering is impossible, the same 
%   number of points is used, but the chosen samples are shifted to accomodate.
%
%   SIGNALDERIVATIVE = FINITE_DIFFERENCES_DERIVATIVE(SIGNALVALUE) calculates
%   the derivative SIGNALDERIVATIVE of the input signal SIGNALVALUE. It is
%   assumed the the interval between each sample (step size) is '1', that the 
%   first-order derivative is required, and that 7 points should be used to 
%   compute said derivative.
%
%   SIGNALDERIVATIVE = FINITE_DIFFERENCES_DERIVATIVE(SIGNALVALUE,SIGNALSTEP)
%   allows for the specification of the step-size used SIGNALSTEP. SIGNALSTEP
%   can also be given as an array of time with the same size as SIGNALVALUE,
%   in which case the mean difference between each sample will be used to
%   approximate the step size.
%
%   SIGNALDERIVATIVE = FINITE_DIFFERENCES_DERIVATIVE(SIGNALVALUE,SIGNALSTEP,
%   DERIVATIVEORDER) allows one to choose the derivative order DERIVATIVEORDER
%   of the output.
%
%   SIGNALDERIVATIVE = FINITE_DIFFERENCES_DERIVATIVE(SIGNALVALUE,SIGNALSTEP,
%   DERIVATIVEORDER,NPOINT) allows one to choose how many points will be used in
%   the finite differentes to approximate the derivative. Value is supposed to 
%   be an odd number, as derivatives are calculated centered around each point, 
%   which leads to symmetric relative indices, such as [-1,0,1] and 
%   [-2,-1,0,1,2], whose length must be odd-numbered.
%
%   Inputs:
%       - SIGNALVALUE : (1,nSample) double
%       - SIGNALSTEP : double OR (1,nSample) double
%       - DERIVATIVEORDER : integer
%       - NPOINT : integer
%
%   Output:
%       - SIGNALDERIVATIVE : (1,nSample) double
