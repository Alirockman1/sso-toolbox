%SAMPLING_FULL_FACTORIAL Full-factorial sampling inside a design box
%   SAMPLING_FULL_FACTORIAL generates a full factorial design of experiments in 
%   the given desired boundaries.
%   The number of designs desired must be compatible with the number of 
%   dimensions of the problem. In other words, (number of samples)^(1/dimension)
%   must be an integer.
%   Optionally, one can also perform a condensed full factorial design of 
%   experiments; by 'condensed', it means the extremities are not used as part  
%   of the places to sample. For example, for a sample of a single variable with
%   two levels between 0 and 1, full factorial would produce the sample [0,1]; 
%   the condensed full factorial instead produces [1/3, 2/3]. For three levels, 
%   full factorial would produce [0, 0.5, 1], and condensed full factorial 
%   [0.25,0.50,0.75], and so on.
%
%   DESIGNSAMPLE = SAMPLING_FULL_FACTORIAL(DESIGNBOX,NSAMPLE) produces NSAMPLE
%   design samples inside design box DESIGNBOX, returning that as DESIGNSAMPLE.
%   Said samples are distributed equally by levels for each design variable, 
%   with the number of levels of the full factorial being computed as 
%   NSAMPLE^(1/nDesignVariable).
%
%   DESIGNSAMPLE = SAMPLING_FULL_FACTORIAL(...NAME,VALUE,...) allows
%   for the use of the condensed full factorial if the property 'Condensed' is
%   set to 'true'.
%
%   Inputs:
%       - DESIGNBOX : (2,nDesignVariable) double
%           -- (1) : lower boundary of the design box
%           -- (2) : upper boundary of the design box
%       - NSAMPLE : integer
%       - 'Condensed' : logical
%
%   Output:
%       - DESIGNSAMPLE : (nSample,nDesignVariable) double
