function saveFolder = save_diary_files(folderName,archiveFiles,additionalSearchFolders)
%SAVE_DIARY_FILES Create a folder where console is logged and files can be saved
%   SAVE_DIARY_FILES creates a folder where all data generated from the 
%   currently running script may be saved. Also initializes 'diary', so all 
%   console input/output is also saved in a .txt file.
%
%   SAVEFOLDER = SAVE_DIARY_FILES(FOLDERNAME) creates a folder named FOLDERNAME
%   with the following structure, starting from the primary working directory: 
%   '/RESULTS/<FOLDERNAME>/Data-<Timestamp>/'. It initializes 'diary' as a text 
%   file in said folder as well, writing the console outputs to this file. The 
%   path to that folder is returned as SAVEFOLDER. For FOLDERNAME, a suggestion 
%   is to use the name of the script, which can be obtained with 'mfilename'.
%
%   SAVEFOLDER = SAVE_DIARY_FILES(FOLDERNAME,ARCHIVEFILES) also creates an 
%   additional folder '/Files/' inside SAVEFOLDER and creates copies of files 
%   ARCHIVEFILES and puts said copies there. This can be used for archival 
%   purposes. Files are searched in all folders currently in the 'path' and
%   the primary working directory.
%
%   SAVEFOLDER = SAVE_DIARY_FILES(FOLDERNAME,ARCHIVEFILES,
%   ADDITIONALSEARCHFOLDERS) allows for the specification of additional folders
%   where the files of ARCHIVEFILES may be found.
%
%   Input:
%       - FOLDERNAME : string
%       - ARCHIVEFILES : (nFile,1) cell
%       - ADDITIONALSEARCHFOLDERS : (nFolder,1) cell
%
%   Output:
%       - SAVEFOLDER : string
%
%   See also diary, mfilename, mkdir, path, isfile, copyfile, get_date_time.
