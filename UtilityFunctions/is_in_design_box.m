function [isInside,score] = is_in_design_box(designSample,designBox)
%IS_IN_DESIGN_BOX Test if design sample points are inside a design box
%   IS_IN_DESIGN_BOX tests if the given design sample points are inside a design
%   box (lower and upper boundaries for each design variable).
%
%   ISINSIDE = IS_IN_DESIGN_BOX(DESIGNSAMPLE,DESIGNBOX) checks if the design 
%   sample points DESIGNSAMPLE are inside the design box DESIGNBOX, checking for  
%   each sample if it is inside ('true') or outside ('false') of said box, 
%   aggregating results in ISINSIDE.
%
%   [ISINSIDE,SCORE] = IS_IN_DESIGN_BOX(...) also returns a score for each 
%   sample point; said score can be computed as follows:
%       - lower limit score: (box lower limit - design variable value) 
%                            / interval size
%       - upper limit score: (design variable value - box upper limit)
%                            / interval size
%       - score : maximum between lower limit and upper limit score
%
%   Input:
%       - DESIGNSAMPLE : (nSample,nDesignVariable)
%       - DESIGNBOX : (2,nDesignVariable)
%           -- (1) : lower boundary of the design box
%           -- (2) : upper boundary of the design box
%
%   Output:
%       - INSIDE : (nSample,1) logical
%       - SCORE : (nSample,1) double
