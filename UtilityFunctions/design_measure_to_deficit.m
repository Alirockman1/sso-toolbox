%DESIGN_MEASURE_TO_DEFICIT Deficit of design given measures and the requirements
%   DESIGN_MEASURE_TO_DEFICIT is used to compute the (performance/physical
%   feasibility) deficit of a design given its (performance/physical 
%   feasibility) measures previously computed and the limits imposed on the
%   system.
%   A normalization of the measures is done, and the deficit can is computed
%   in the following way:
%       - lower limit deficit: (lower limit - measure) / normalization factor
%       - upper limit deficit: (measure - upper limit) / normalization factor
%       - deficit : maximum between lower limit and upper limit deficit
%   In this way, measures that are within their given limits are given deficit 
%   values <0 and otherwise deficit values >0.
%
%   DEFICIT = DESIGN_MEASURE_TO_DEFICIT(MEASURE) receives the measures of design
%   sample points in MEASURE and returns the deficits of each measure in 
%   DEFICIT. All other inputs assume their default values, where lower limits 
%   are assumed to not apply, upper limits are assumed to be 0 and the 
%   normalization factor is computed on-thy-fly based on the given measures and
%   limits.
%
%   DEFICIT = DESIGN_MEASURE_TO_DEFICIT(MEASURE,LOWERLIMIT) allows for the 
%   specification of minimum values required for the measures in LOWERLIMIT.
%   Its default value is '-inf'. If any entry is set to 'nan', that entry will 
%   be assumed to be '-inf' as well.
%
%   DEFICIT = DESIGN_MEASURE_TO_DEFICIT(MEASURE,LOWERLIMIT,UPPERLIMIT) allows for  
%   the specification of maximum values required for the measures in UPPERLIMIT.
%   Its default value is '0'. If any entry is set to 'nan', that entry will 
%   be assumed to be '+inf'.
%
%   DEFICIT = DESIGN_MEASURE_TO_DEFICIT(MEASURE,LOWERLIMIT,UPPERLIMIT,
%   NORMALIZATIONFACTOR) also allows for the specification of the normalization
%   factors to be used in deficit computation in NORMALIZATIONFACTOR. Default
%   value is 'nan'. If any entry is set to 'nan', that entry will be computed
%   on-the-fly based on the given measures and limits.
%
%   Inputs:
%       - MEASURE :  (nSample,nMeasure) double
%       - LOWERLIMIT : (1,nMeasure) double, optional
%       - UPPERLIMIT : (1,nMeasure) double, optional
%       - NORMALIZATIONFACTOR : (1,nMeasure) double, optional
%
%   Output:
%       - DEFICIT : (nSample,nMeasure) double
