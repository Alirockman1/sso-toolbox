%GROW_SAMPLE_REGION_POSITIVE_LABEL Expansion of labeled region by given factor
%   GROW_SAMPLE_REGION_POSITIVE_LABEL will expand the region labeled as positive 
%   by the factor given. Said growth is done in a fixed rate defined by the 
%   input relative to the design space. This is an isotropic expansion.
%
%   [DESIGNSAMPLEEXPANDED,LABELEXPANDED] = GROW_SAMPLE_REGION_POSITIVE_LABEL(
%   DESIGNSAMPLE,LABEL,DESIGNSPACELOWERBOUND,DESIGNSPACEUPPERBOUND,GROWTHRATE)
%   takes the design sample points DESIGNSAMPLE which are labeled LABEL,
%   the design space DESIGNSPACELOWERBOUND and DESIGNSPACEUPPERBOUND, and the
%   growth rate factor GROWTHRATE, and produces new sample points 
%   DESIGNSAMPLEEXPANDED which are labeled LABELEXPANDED depending on their
%   distances to the original positive-label points. The expansion is done both
%   outwards and inwards.
%
%   [...] = GROW_SAMPLE_REGION_POSITIVE_LABEL(...,NAME,VALUE,...) allows the 
%   specification of additional arguments; here, these arguments are used when
%   computing distances for defining the growth with 'knnsearch'.
%
%   Inputs:
%       - DESIGNSAMPLE : (nSample,nDesignVariable) double
%       - LABEL : (nSample,1) logical
%       - DESIGNSPACELOWERBOUND : (1,nDesignVariable) double
%       - DESIGNSPACEUPPERBOUND : (1,nDesignVariable) double
%       - GROWTHRATE : double
%       - Name-value pair arguments: passed to 'knnsearch'
%
%   Output:
%       - DESIGNSAMPLEEXPANDED : (3*nSample,nDesignVariable) double
%       - LABELEXPANDED : (3*nSample,1) logical
