%PLOT_SVM_DECISION_BOUNDARY_3D Visualize the decision boundary of a SVM
%   PLOT_SVM_DECISION_BOUNDARY_3D plots a visualization of a Support Vector 
%   Machine decision boundary in 3D. It estimates where the boundary is via the
%   scores applied to a large sample, and using isosurface and patch to plot 
%   where that score is closest to 0.
%
%   PLOT_SVM_DECISION_BOUNDARY_3D(FIGUREHANDLE,SVM) plots in figure FIGUREHANDLE
%   the decision boundary of Support Vector Machine SVM. Said decision boundary 
%   is shown with its edges in black.
%
%   PLOT_SVM_DECISION_BOUNDARY_3D(...,NAME,VALUE,...) allows for setting
%   additional options for the plot operation; said options should refer to the
%   'patch' function.
%
%   PLOTHANDLE = PLOT_SVM_DECISION_BOUNDARY_2D(...) returns the handle of the
%   generated plot PLOTHANDLE as a result of 'patch', which can be used later 
%   for 'legend', for example.
%
%   Inputs:
%       - FIGUREHANDLE : Figure
%       - SVM : ClassificationSVM
%       - Name-value pair arguments: passed directly to 'patch'.
%
%   Output:
%       - PLOTHANDLE : Line
%
%   See also patch, ClassificationSVM, legend, isosurface.
