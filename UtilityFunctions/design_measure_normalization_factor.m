%DESIGN_MEASURE_NORMALIZATION_FACTOR Normalization factor for measures
%   DESIGN_MEASURE_NORMALIZATION_FACTOR calculates an appropriate normalization  
%   factor which may be used for the measures of a design sample; it does so 
%   based on the given limits and, if necessary, on the measure acquired.
%   - For values with well-defined limits: upper limit - lower limit;
%   - If either is not suitable: absolute value of the other limit;
%   - If both are not suitable: maximum measure - minimum measure;
%   - If that result is not suitable: absolute value of the mean of measures; 
%   - Last case: 1.
%   
%   NORMALIZATIONFACTOR = DESIGN_MEASURE_NORMALIZATION_FACTOR(MEASURE) receives
%   the measures of the design samples in MEASURE and computes the normalization
%   factor, returning it in NORMALIZATIONFACTOR.
%
%   NORMALIZATIONFACTOR = DESIGN_MEASURE_NORMALIZATION_FACTOR(MEASURE,
%   LOWERLIMIT) allows for the specification of the desired lower limit for the
%   measures in LOWERLIMIT. Default value is 'inf'. If any entry is set to 
%   'nan', that entry will be assumed to be '-inf' as well.
%
%   NORMALIZATIONFACTOR = DESIGN_MEASURE_NORMALIZATION_FACTOR(MEASURE,
%   LOWERLIMIT,UPPERLIMIT) allows for the specification of the desired upper 
%   limit for the measures in UPPERLIMIT. Default value is '0'. If any entry  
%   is set to 'nan', that entry will be assumed to be '+inf'.
%
%   Inputs:
%       - MEASURE : (nSample,nMeasure) double
%       - LOWERLIMIT : (1,nMeasure) double
%       - UPPERLIMIT : (1,nMeasure) double
%
%   Output:
%       - NORMALIZATIONFACTOR : (1,nMeasure) double
