function [minDistanceOrder,minPathDistance] = design_sort_min_distance(queryDesign,varargin)
%DESIGN_SORT_MIN_DISTANCE Sort designs by minimum distance in sequence
%	DESIGN_SORT_MIN_DISTANCE returns an ordered index of the designs in a 
%	query that have the minimum distance to the previous selected one. 
%	The order starts at the first design of the query, then goes to the design
%	closest to the first one, then to the one closest to the second (not 
%	counting the first), and so on.
%	This is a greedy / nearest-neighbor strategy to solve a problem similar to 
%	a hamiltonian weighted path problem, except instead of the total distance
%	being the quantity to be minimized, it is the maximum distance traveled
%	at any point in the path, while moving to the closest point available.
%
%	MINDISTANCEORDER = DESIGN_SORT_MIN_DISTANCE(QUERYDESIGN) orders the designs 
%	present in the query QUERYDESIGN in such a way that each design is the 
%	closest available to the previous one, returning the order in 
%	MINDISTANCEORDER. To compute distances, 'knnsearch' is used. All given 
%	points in the query are used as initial points from which the path is 
%	computed, and the one with the smallest maximum distance between two points
%	is chosen as best.
%
%	MINDISTANCEORDER = DESIGN_SORT_MIN_DISTANCE(QUERYDESIGN,NINITIAL) allows one 
%	to set the number of points with which it starts finding the path NINITIAL. 
%	This goes in order of the designs given in QUERYDESIGN. In this way, one
%	can turn a quadratic-scaling problem into a linear one, at the cost of the
%	quality of the result.
%
%	MINDISTANCEORDER = DESIGN_SORT_MIN_DISTANCE(...,NAME,VALUE,...) allows one 
%	to set additional options for distance computation; these name-value pairs 
%	are used in 'knnsearch' directly.
%
%	[MINDISTANCEORDER,MINPATHDISTANCE] = DESIGN_SORT_MIN_DISTANCE(...)  
%	additionally returns the computed distance between each design and the 
%	previous one. The total path length can be computed by summing all values
%	in this array.
