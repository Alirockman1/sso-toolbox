%DESIGNEVALUATORMULTIFIDELITY Design Evaluator that mixes high- and low-fidelity
%   DESIGNEVALUATORMULTIFIDELITY allows one to use two different design 
%   evaluators, one which is high-fidelity and one which is low-fidelity. In 
%   general, the low-fidelity one is used first on all requested sample points, 
%   and for the designs where it is deemed that there is uncertainty, the high-
%   fidelity model is then used. This is done to minimize the function calls
%   to the high-fidelity model (which is assumed to be more expensive).
%
%   This class is derived from DesignEvaluatorBase.
%
%   DESIGNEVALUATORMULTIFIDELITY methods:
%       - evaluate : a function that receives the design samples and returns 
%       their deficit in terms of performance and physical feasibility relative
%       to the requirements.

        %DESIGNEVALUATORLOWFIDELITY Low-fidelity model
        %   DESIGNEVALUATORLOWFIDELITY is the low-fidelity design evaluator. It is used
        %   every time for every sample point that has to be evaluated. It is based on
        %   its output (and how uncertain it is) that the high-fidelity model may or
        %   may not be called.
