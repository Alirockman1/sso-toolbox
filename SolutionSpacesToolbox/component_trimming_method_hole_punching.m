%COMPONENT_TRIMMING_METHOD_HOLE_PUNCHING Component SSO Trimming
%   COMPONENT_TRIMMING_METHOD_HOLE_PUNCHING uses the hole punching method to 
%   find the sample points for candidate removal during the trimming operation 
%   of the component SSO procedure.
%   In hole punching, all design points within a certain distance of the 
%   removal point are trimmed.
%
%   REMOVALCANDIDATE = COMPONENT_TRIMMING_METHOD_HOLE_PUNCHING(
%   DESIGNSAMPLECOMPONENT,IREMOVE) receives the design sample points 
%   of the component space in DESIGNSAMPLECOMPONENT and the index of the design
%   to be removed IREMOVE, and returns all trimming possibilities in 
%   REMOVALCANDIDATE. 
%
%   Input:
%       - DESIGNSAMPLECOMPONENT : (nSample,nComponentDesignVariable) double
%       - IREMOVE : integer
%
%   Output:
%       - REMOVALCANDIDATE : (nSample,1) logical
%
