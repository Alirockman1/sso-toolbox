classdef (Abstract) CandidateSpaceBase
%CANDIDATESPACEBASE Candidate Space abstract class for component solution spaces
%   CANDIDATESPACEBASE provides the necessary interfaces for particular 
%   implementations that may serve as candidate spaces when performing the
%   computation of component solution spaces.
%
%   As an abstract class, particular implementations have to be created using 
%   this as base for one to be able to create objects.
%
%   CANDIDATESPACEBASE properties:
%       - DesignSampleDefinition : design sample points used in the candidate 
%       space definition.
%       - IsInsideDefinition : logical labels of the design sample points used   
%       in the candidate space definition regarding whether they are inside or 
%       outside the candidate space (true = inside, false = outside).
%       - IsShapeDefinition : logical labels of the design sample points used in 
%       the candidate space definition regarding whether these designs are 
%       directly related to the shape of the candidate space (or in other words,
%       the design sample points that define the boundary itself and are used
%       to identify if a design is inside/outside this space).
%       - ActiveDesign : sample points that are labeled as inside.
%       - Measure : measure of the candidate space (usually area/volume/etc).
%       - SamplingBox : bounding box around the internal region of the candidate
%       space that can be used to better attempt to sample inside said region.
%       - SamplingBoxSlack : a value used to give the defined amount of slack
%       for the SamplingBox, varying between the strict bounding box around the 
%       internal region and a larger bounding box which may contain negative
%       designs in its edges. 
%       - GrowthDistanceOptions : options to be used when computing the distance 
%       that the candidate space will grow to. In its default base 
%       implementation, these are options to 'knnsearch'.
%
%   CANDIDATESPACEBASE methods:
%       - define_candidate_space : create a candidate space based on design 
%       samples that are labeled as inside/outside.
%       - grow_candidate_space : expand the candidate space by a given factor.
%       - is_in_candidate_space : verify if given design samples are inside 
%       the candidate space.
%       - plot_candidate_space : visualize 1D/2D/3D candidate spaces in given
%       figure.
