classdef CandidateSpaceAlphaShape < CandidateSpaceBase
%CANDIDATESPACEALPHASHAPE Candidate Space defined by delaunay triangulation
%   CANDIDATESPACEALPHASHAPE can be used to define candidate spaces for  
%   component solution space computation. In this case, the candidate space is 
%   defined mainly through an alphaShape object.
%   As this uses alphaShape as a base, this type of candidate space can only
%   be used for 2D and 3D problems.
%
%   This class is derived from CandidateSpaceBase.
%
%   CANDIDATESPACEALPHASHAPE properties:
%       - DesignSampleDefinition : design sample points used in the candidate 
%       space definition.
%       - IsInsideDefinition : logical labels of the design sample points used   
%       in the candidate space definition regarding whether they are inside or 
%       outside the candidate space (true = inside, false = outside).
%       - IsShapeDefinition : logical labels of the design sample points used in 
%       the candidate space definition regarding whether these designs are 
%       directly related to the shape of the candidate space (or in other words,
%       the design sample points that define the boundary itself and are used
%       to identify if a design is inside/outside this space).
%       - ActiveDesign : sample points that are labeled as inside.
%       - Measure : measure of the candidate space (usually area/volume/etc).
%       - SamplingBox : bounding box around the internal region of the candidate
%       space that can be used to better attempt to sample inside said region.
%       - SamplingBoxSlack : a value used to give the defined amount of slack
%       for the SamplingBox, varying between the strict bounding box around the 
%       internal region and a larger bounding box which may contain negative
%       designs in its edges. 
%       - AlphaShapeOptions : additional options when training the alphaShape 
%       object. 
%       - CriticalAlphaType : criterion for the minimum value of alpha radius
%       allowed.
%   CANDIDATESPACEALPHASHAPE methods:
%       - define_candidate_space : create a candidate space based on design 
%       samples that are labeled as inside/outside.
%       - grow_candidate_space : expand the candidate space by a given factor.
%       - is_in_candidate_space : verify if given design samples are inside 
%       the candidate space.
%       - plot_candidate_space : visualize 1D/2D/3D candidate spaces in given
%       figure.
